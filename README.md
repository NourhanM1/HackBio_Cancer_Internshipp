# **RNA-seq:**

RNA-Seq is an important tool in biomedical research in view of detecting and quantifying the different populations of RNA. It has revolutionized biomedical research by making it possible for researchers to analyze huge data regarding living things. Analysis of RNA-seq by computational methods can detect novel exons and transcripts, thus enabling the quantification of gene expression and study of alternative splicing structure. Understanding the biological and computational foundations of RNA-seq data generation, analysis, and software development will result in more deliberate use of existing computational tools.

# **Machine learning:**

Machine learning is the ability to use computers to solve problems, by learning from historical data to predict the desired output that will help enhance the decision making.  In bioinformatics, machine learning can help by building models that can be used to detect patterns within biological inputs like genomes, healthcare data, etc. ML trains from these biological data and makes predictions ML techniques are applied in two main biological domains omics science and systems biology. It can be applied to analyzing biological data from various areas like predicting the gene locations and their biological roles, predicting protein or molecular functions, and studying the interactions between them Also, predicting diseases from molecular samples and more and more.

In biomedical and bioinformatics research, data from omics studies have been utilized for the prediction and categorization of numerous diseases. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have found widespread application in healthcare systems in recent years, particularly in the areas of disease prediction and classification.

Integration of molecular omics data with ML algorithms has offered a great opportunity to evaluate clinical data. Which can help in disease prediction and classification tasks. The goal of using machine learning in this approach is to build standard ML models for identifying the cancer stage and predictions of diseases.

# **Conclusion:**

The integration of RNA-Seq and machine learning offers a promising avenue for advancing biomedical research. By leveraging the power of RNA-Seq to analyze gene expression and alternative splicing, combined with the predictive capabilities of machine learning, researchers can gain valuable insights into disease mechanisms, develop more effective diagnostics, and potentially identify novel therapeutic targets.

While this field is still evolving, the potential benefits are significant. Future research should focus on addressing the challenges associated with data quality, feature selection, and model interpretability, as well as exploring the ethical implications of using ML in biomedical research. By overcoming these hurdles, we can harness the full potential of RNA-Seq and machine learning to improve human health and well-being.
