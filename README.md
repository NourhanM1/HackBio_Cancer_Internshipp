 # Unsupervised Learning in Cancer:
# # Introduction to unsupervised Learning in Cancer
Unsupervised learning is a machine learning approach that uses data without labels to find patterns and structures. This method has value in cancer research to identify cancer subtypes, which are distinct molecular features of related diseases. This aids personalized medicine, as each subtype has different outcomes and responses to treatment. In breast cancer studies, unsupervised learning groups tumors into molecular subtypes. It also helps to find biomarkers, which can tell cancerous tissues from non-cancerous ones and predict patient outcomes. 
# # Importance of Breast Cancer Subtype Classification
Breast cancer subtype classification plays a key role in tailoring treatment because tumors differ. Doctors have used immunohistochemistry (IHC) to stand in for gene expression profiling, but early detection has limits due to false negatives and its invasive nature. Recent breakthroughs in radiogenomics have led to more use of imaging in genetic research. 
Researchers are developing deep learning algorithms to give quick insights for precision medicine, but how well they work often depends on the data used to train them. Scientists are looking into transfer learning, which allows the use of prior knowledge or features from specific source areas, to classify breast cancer subtypes from dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI.
# # Proposed Methodologies
This study suggests two new ways to learn about breast cancer without supervision. These methods called Malignant Ensemble Learning (M_EL) and Benign Ensemble Learning (B_EL), help tell apart different types of breast cancer. They do this by looking at datasets of both dangerous and harmless breast problems. The main goal is to keep as many important features as possible using encoders. The new model can hold onto key information during training without supervision. It does this by making the mean square error (MI) as big as possible and keeping it within a set range instead of using mean square error or cross entropy.
Tests show that M_EL and B_EL work better than CLSTM when starting from scratch. They also make good use of the changing information in DCE-MRI pictures taken after contrast is given. The model can also work well between similar areas showing it can be used more.
# # Conclusion
Unsupervised learning is a machine learning strategy that is connected in cancer inquire about to decide subtypes of cancer, which are diverse atomic characteristics shared by cancers that are related. Unsupervised learning is utilized in breast cancer investigate to reveal biomarkers for early determination and forecast and to classify tumors into atomic subtypes.
